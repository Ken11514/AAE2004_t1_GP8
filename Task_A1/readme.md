# Additional Task 1
## Adding Checkpoints
----
# Background
Assume the aircraft is a supply craft that must rech 2 drop-off points to drop supplies before heading to base.
# Task objectives
- Add 1 checkpoint for each cost intensive area
- Reach all checkpoint before arriving at the destination

# Our map

# Things to do
- Creat a new code based on theprevious one
- Add 2 checkpoints
- Checkpoints should be generated inside the cost intensive areas
- Re define the goal point
- plot the checkpoints together with toyr planned plath with appropriate visulization

# Finding the route with checkpoints
-Step1: Randomly find 2 checkpoints inside each cost intensive area by coding
-Step2: cut the whole path into 3 different route
-Step3: Plot all of 3 routes 
-Step4: combine 3 routes into the whole path
