&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grid format, all possabale path position are recognized as node, and can be assigned a weight to show the traveling cost, which show as follows.
<br><br>
<b>Step 1</b>, calculate the traveling cost form start point to its adjacent and diagonal notes. Then base on each node, calculate heuristic estimated cost, the displacement, between itself and end point. After combine the traveling cost and heuristic estimated cost, a weight of the node can be obtainted.The data are stored in a list of possable step.<br><br>
<b>Step 2</b>, select the lowest weight node from the list as repersenting the position of the <b>first</b> step apporaching to the End Point. Then append it to a list which recorded evey step it moved to.
<br><br>
<b>Step 3</b>, repeat Step 1 and Step 2 untill it reaches the End point, A list of the movement can be obtained.

## a. Methodology
<ol type='I'>
<h3><li>Information</li></h3>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most of the fights do not always follow the same route, it is important for airlines to find the shortest route to reach their destination as it not only saves time but also saves money by decreasing fuel consumption. Additionally, the most efficient aircraft model is selected based on the route that helps minimize the flight cost. In this task, we are going to find the best aircraft models with minimum cost for the shortest route found for the given challenge keeping the needs of passsengers in mind.

|Time cost (High)($/min)|20|27|34|
|Fixed Cost($)|1800|2000|2500|

<br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trip cost equation</h3>

$Cost=C_{Fuel} \cdot \Delta F \cdot T_{best} +C_{Time}\cdot T_{best}+C_{Fixed}$

<br>
$C_{fuel}$: fuel cost<br>
$\Delta F$: consumed fuel<br>
$T_{best}$: traveling time (mins)<br>
$C_{Time}$: time cost<br>
$C_{Fixed}$: fixed cost <br>

<h3>Detail of each scenarios</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By using the given formula, the cost of the trip can be calculated without any difficulty and according to it, A330-900neo has the lowest trip cost for scenario 1. Additionally, for both scenario 2 and 3, the aircraft model with the lowest trip cost is A350-900.

The blue star represents the start node while the green star represents the end node or the goal node. An aircraft travelling from the start node to the goal node might follow a more convenient route keeping the fuel and time-consuming area in mind to lower the total trip cost. And this route for the given challenge is presented by the red line starting from the start node and ending at the goal node.

## c. Discussion

<p >
Talk about how the task related to aviation
 
  As mentioned above,one of the main goal of finding the shortest route for the aircraft is saving the travel time.Aircraft has a uncompetitive speed advantage to the another kind of transportation method.This is the reason why do the aviation activity are so important to the transportation system of the world.Besides improving the convience and the efficency of the aviation activity,finding the shorest route has the meaning on fulfilling the special requirements of the passengers Expectally for the passengers or cargo which need to travel internationally as fast as possible,it include animals like horse,rhino and other kind of big animals.As you can see,this is one of the related point between this task and the aviation. 
  
  For another,taking the shorest route means it take the shorest travel time.It means the aircraft will provide lesser pollutant to the environment.Because taking the aircraft is the most carbon emission activity in the world,the offical and private aviation organisations like ICAO and IATA always demand the airline to lower the amount of carbon emission.And this is the way to acheive that goal.As you can see,this is the another related point between the task and aviation.

<!-- Task 2 -->
# **5 | Task 2**
## a. Methodology
<ol type='I'>
<h3><li>Information</h3>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During path planing, we need to take many variables in count, not only aircraft mode, but also the environment. In reallife there are certain area called Jet Steam Area, where aircrafts could consume reltively less fuel and redust traveling cost. In this task, we are going to recreate a Jet Steam area with a situation that could benefit our flight route the most.
</dd>&nbsp;</li>

<h3><li>Data for Task 2</h3>
<ul>
  The situation:
  <li>Use Task 1 of scenario 1 as the background</li>
  <li>Find a best place for seting the Jet Steam Area</li>
  <li>Cost along the Jet Steam Area is reduced by 5%</li>
  <li>The area of the Jet Steam must span across the map laterally and span 5-unit length vertically

</li>
<h3><li>Procedure</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 2 major part in our apporach, 'Finding the best place of jet steam area' and 'Cost calculation' .
<h3>1. Finding the best place of jet steam area
</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maximize the effect of jet steam area, we need to find a section(5 continuous y-coordinates) that covered by most of the flight route. 
<h3>2. Cost calculation</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new cost intensive area which decrease 5% cost should be added in the input data. As this task shar the same background of task 1 scenario 1, the calculation for trivaling cost can refre to task 1 scenario 1.

<h3><li>Procedure</h3><dd>    
<p align='center'>
explain how to achive and what skills we used

For the way how will achive the goal,we have decsided 3 different model of aircraft with different maximum passenger capacities for comparison.250,300 and 450. Since of the requirement of senerio 1 are transporting 3000 passengers in one week and the maximum number of flight per week is 12,the lowest possible passengers capacity of the aircraft is 250.Therefore,although the requirment mentioned in task 3 is the lowest capacity of a aircraft is 100,we don't use it as our minimum capacity of the aircraft.For what skills we used,we calculated the total cost on our own.According to the equation,we put different data into the equation and we got different outcomes.For example,we use $882.3/mt into the fuel cost and 77.18376541764 minutes as the time in all different models.(THIS IS PIE CHART)
</p>
</ol>

## b. Results

<p align='center'>
show our result and explain what does the result repersent

As you can see from the table,The model with 450 passengers as the maximum capacity require $71844 to fulfill the requirment of senerio 1,and the model with 300 and 250 passengers as their maximum capacithy require $98003 and $78064.The model 3 has the lowest total in 3 model.(THIS IS BAR CHART)This model reuire 7 trips to transport all 3000 passengers from start point to goal point and model 2 and 1 require 10 and 12 total trips.Although the operating cost of model 3 each flight is the highest in 3 models,the total trips are the lowest.Therefore,the nember of total trips are the most important element to lower the total cost instead of the cost each flight in this situation.For further informations,the name of our 4 enginee aircraft will be P801. P stands for Polyu,(8) stands for our group number and finish the mission with the highest efficiency and takeing the lowest cost and requirment are the meanings of (01)

## c. Discussion

<p align='center'>
Talk about how the task related to aviation

Compare to another type of transportation method,the manufacture and the operating cost of an aircraft are in a extremely high level.Besides gaining the profit from the commerical flight,airlines are required to surver the gigantic operating cost from different areas.The operating cost of aircraft in each flight are the biggest outcome of the airlines besides owning a aircraft. There is a significant differences of operating cost to fulfill the requirement between in different mode of maximum passengers capacity to meet the requirement of senerio 1.If the airlines doesn't choose the most efficency mode,there will be planty of unnesscary economic resources are wasted. Therefore,finding the best model to fulfill the requirment in the lowest operating cost to prevent the unnesscary waste are extremely important to the aviation.
