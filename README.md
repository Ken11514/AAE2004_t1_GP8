&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grid format, all possabale path position are recognized as node, and can be assigned a weight to show the traveling cost, which show as follows.
<br><br>
<b>Step 1</b>, calculate the traveling cost form start point to its adjacent and diagonal notes. Then base on each node, calculate heuristic estimated cost, the displacement, between itself and end point. After combine the traveling cost and heuristic estimated cost, a weight of the node can be obtainted. The data are stored in a list of possable step.<br><br>
<b>Step 2</b>, select the lowest weight node from the list as repersenting the position of the <b>first</b> step apporaching to the End Point. Then append it to a list which recorded evey step it moved to.
<br><br>
<b>Step 3</b>, repeat Step 1 and Step 2 until it reaches the End point, A list of the movement can be obtained.
<br><br>
<b>Step 4</b>, Track back from the list of movement, a route of shortest path can be viewed.<br><br>

## b. Results

<p align='center'>
<image src='images/Task_1_Scenario_1.gif'><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By using the given formula, the cost of the trip can be calculated without any difficulty and according to it, A330-900neo has the lowest trip cost for scenario 1. Additionally, for both scenario 2 and 3, the aircraft model with the lowest trip cost is A350-900.

The blue star represents the start node while the green star represents the end node or the goal node. An aircraft travelling from the start node to the goal node might follow a more convenient route keeping the fuel and time-consuming area in mind to lower the total trip cost. In addition this route for the given challenge is presented by the red line starting from the start node and ending at the goal node.

</p>

## c. Discussion

<p align='center'>
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, one of the main goal of finding the shortest route for the aircraft is saving the travel time. Aircraft has a uncompetitive speed advantage to the other kind of transportation method. This is the reason why do the aviation activity are so important to the transportation system of the world. Besides improving the convience and the efficency of the aviation activity, finding the shorest route has the meaning on fulfilling the special requirements of the passengers Expectally for the passengers or cargo which need to travel internationally as fast as possible, it include animals like horse, rhino and other kind of big animals. As it mentioned, this is one of the related point between this task and the aviation. 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For another,taking the shorest route means it take the shorest travel time. It means the aircraft will provide lesser pollutant to the environment. Because taking the aircraft is the most carbon emission activity in the world,the offical and private aviation organisations like ICAO and IATA frequently demand the airline to lower the amount of carbon emission. In addition, this is the way to achieve that goal. As it mentioned, this is the other related point between the task and aviation.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, task 1 is able to achieve both passengers’ needs and environment protection. For passengers, they will have different kinds of requirements while choosing air flight for travelling such as price, duration and coziness and so on. Besides, passengers will be more likely to choose airline with a higher reputation. Therefore, task 1 can help passengers of selecting the most suitable travelling route as well as meet their needs. Fuels which are use in aviation industry cause harm to our environment. Since carbon dioxide emitted in the aircrafts may enhance the greenhouse effect. However, different type of aircraft have their unique design while the consumption of fuel and time in the same route will be different too. As a result, the results of task 1 are needed to maintain a high quality level of environment.

# **5 | Task 2**
## a. Methodology
<ol type='I'>
<h3><li>Information</h3>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During path planing, we need to take many variables in count, not only aircraft mode, but also the environment. In reallife there are certain area called Jet Steam Area, where aircrafts could consume reltively less fuel and redust traveling cost. In this task, we are going to recreate a Jet Steam area with a situation that could benefit our flight route the most.

<h3><li>Procedure</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 2 major part in our apporach, 'Finding the best place of jet steam area' and 'Cost calculation' .
<h3>1. Finding the best place of jet steam area
</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maximize the effect of jet steam area, we need to find a section(5 continuous y-coordinates) that covered by most of the flight route. 
<h3>2. Cost calculation</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new cost intensive area which decrease 5% cost should be added in the input data. As this task shar the same background of task 1 scenario 1, the calculation for trivaling cost can refre to task 1 scenario 1.

## c. Discussion

<p align='center'>

Sometimes we can borrow thw power from the environment to help us to achieve our goal or even finish it in a higher efficency which includes the aviation activity. For example,using the wind power brings a higher speed than manpower for a ship in the past. Those kind od advantage can be seen more clearly in the jet stream area, If the aircraft fly through those area, it brings a clear effect on lower the operatiing cost . For example, there is a stronger wind power inside the jet stream area which provide a stronger lifting force for the aircraft, and the aircraft will be able to lower it's thrust and reducing it's fuel cost. As it mentioned, this is one of the related point between this task and he aviation.

<p align='center'>


For the way how will achieve the goal, we have decsided 3 different model of aircraft with different maximum passenger capacities for comparison. 250,300 and 450. Since of the requirement of senerio 1 are transporting 3000 passengers in one week and the maximum number of flight per week is 12, the lowest possible passengers capacity of the aircraft is 250. Therefore, although the requirment mentioned in task 3 is the lowest capacity of an aircraft is 100, this are not going to be used as our minimum capacity of the aircraft. According to the equation, we put different data into the equation and there are different outcomes. For example, we use $882.3/mt into the fuel cost and 77.18376541764 minutes as the time in all different models.
</p></li>
</ol>

## b. Results

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the table mentioned, the model with 450 passengers as the maximum capacity require $71844 to fulfill the requirment of senerio 1, and the model with 300 and 250 passengers as their maximum capacithy require $98003 and $78064.The model 3 has the lowest total in 3 model. This model reuire 7 trips to transport all 3000 passengers from start point to goal point and model 2 and 1 require 10 and 12 total trips.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the operating cost of model 3 each flight is the highest in 3 models, the total trips are the lowest. Therefore, the nember of total trips are the most important element to lower the total cost instead of the cost each flight in this situation.

## c. Discussion

<p align='center'>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For further information of our aircraft,the name of our 4 enginee aircraft will be P801. P stands for Polyu,(8) stands for our group number and finish the mission with highest efficency and taking the lowest cost and requirement are the meanings of (01). <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare to another type of transportation method, the manufacture and the operating cost of an aircraft are in an extremely high level. Not only gaining the profit from the commerical flight, airlines are required to surver the gigantic operating cost from different areas. The operating cost of aircraft in each flight are the biggest outcome of the airlines which is second only to owning an aircraft. There is a significant differences of operating cost to fulfill the requirement between in different mode of maximum passengers capacity to meet the requirement of senerio 1. If the airlines doesn't choose the most efficency mode, there will be planty of unnesscary economic resources are wasted. Therefore, finding the best model to fulfill the requirment in the lowest operating cost to prevent the unnesscary waste are extremely important to the aviation.

As shown in the examples above, the locations for both checkpoints of both examples are totally different since we made it generate randomly within the cost intensive zone. Also it is clear that both checkpoints are reached before heading to the destination. <br><br>




## c. Discussion
<ol type='I'>
<h3><li> Limitation</h3>
<dd>The calculated path by our program might not be the shortest in certain scenario. Our approach tends to fix the path into three parts, from the start to the first checkpoint located in the yellow zone, from the checkpoint in the yellow zone to the one in the red zone, and from the checkpoint in the red zone to the destination. Therefore our program will still go for the longer path from start to the checkpoint in the yellow zone eventhough the distance between the start and checkpoint in red zone is much shorter, creating certain errors. </dd>
<h3><li>Improvement</h3>
<dd>Instead of fixing the direction of the path, for some extreme situation where the distance between the start and the yellow zone checkpoint is further than the distance between the start and the red zone checkpoint, furthur modifications can be done so that the program can calculate the cost and distance for both route and choose the best one without being fixed with certain route (e.g. from start to yellow zone checkpoint), hence reducing error in those situations.</dd>

# **8 | Additional Task 2**
## a. Methodology

<ol type='I'>
<h3><li>Information</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In flight operation enviroment could be different form previou flight. In this task, a keep changeing mission and enviroment are created to simulate the flight operation in real life.</p>
</li>
<h3><li>Requirements for additional task 2</h3>
<ol type='1'>
<li>Only the fule-cost-intensive area remains and generate it randomly with a fixed area of (30x30)</li>
<li>Diagonal movement is disabled, change parameter so that the object could travel with in one grid size</li>
<li>Obstacles are generated randomly with reasonable density and should not generate at/near the start and end point</li>
<li>Destination and starting points are generated randomly with at least a 50-Unit distance in-between</li>
<li>Plotting of fuel-cost-intensive area would not cover the obstacles</li>

</ol>
</li>
<h3><li>Procedure</h3>
<ol type='1' start='0'>
<li>Set up the basic frame:<br> By reusing the previous code, obstacle set are need to be rearanged</li>
<li>Set up fuel-cost-intensive area:<br>
 First assume the area is a random point in the map, its coordinates can be generate inside the frame by <pre>random.randint(-9,60)  #60 is excluded</pre>
Then, assume the point have a width and height of 30 unit. As the area can not generat outside the frame, the range of coordinates of the point should be [-9 , 30]<br>
Thus, the Fule-cost-intensive area can be ploted with the coordinates</li>
<li>Disable diagonal movement:<br>
 Rearange the code <pre>def get_motion_model():</pre>
  object could travel with in one grid size:<br>
  Rearange the code <pre>def calc_obstacle_map(self, ox, oy):</pre>
<li>Random obstacles:<br>
First, get all possible coordinates for obstacle<br>
Then, set a generation rate, and check for the overlaping<br>
After that, plot the obstalces whic meet the condiction
</li>
<li>Random start and end point:<br>
First generate a random satrt point,<br>
Then, by using the forumal of the locus of circle, take coordinates of start point as center of circle and the radious as larger than or equal to 50, while x:[-9,59] and y:[-9,59], all possible coordinates can be obtained,<br>
Finally, choose a random coordinates as the end point coordinate.<pre>def get_goal_coordinate(sx,sy) :
    possible_location = [(i, j)for i in range(-9,60) for j in range(-9,60) if math.sqrt((i-sx)**2+(j-sy)**2)>= 50]
    final_coordinate = random.choice(possable_location)
    return final_coordinate</pre> </li>
<li>Ploting:<br>
plot the fuel-cost-intensive area first to meet the requriment</li>
</ol>
</li>

For 2: by adjuesting the code <pre>    def get_motion_model(): # the cost of the surrounding 8 points
        # dx, dy, cost
        motion = [[1, 0, 1],

                        break</pre><br><br>
For 3: The obstacles can be generate if it meet this condition <pre>    for i in range(-10,60):
        for j in range(-10,60):
            if random.randint(0,100)>= 65 and no_overlap(i,j,sx,sy,gx,gy) :

the 'random.randint(0,100)>= 65' act as a generation rate while <pre>def no_overlap(i, j, sx, sy, gx, gy):

                return False
    return True</pre>it  can prevent the situation of overlaping with start&end point.<br><br>
For 4: The minimum distance can be know as a minimum radius of 50 unit form the start<s> or end</s> point, thus the relationship of start point and end point can be repersented by <strong>locus of circle</strong>. Therefore, by using the fomular of locus of circle , all possable coordinates of the start and end point can be obtained. Furthermore, to simplifi the process, the start point is treated as the center of circle and end point can be collected by <pre>def get_goal_coordinate(sx,sy) :
    possable_location = [(i, j)for i in range(-9,60) for j in range(-9,60) if math.sqrt((i-sx)**2+(j-sy)**2)>= 50]
    final_coordinate = random.choice(possable_location)
    return final_coordinate</pre>

</tr>
</table>


## c. Discussion

<p >
<h3>1. Result discussion</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the results that there is no possable route, since there are obstacles forming a loop and isolating the start and end point, path cant not be formed. Althrough there are chances of no route can formed, the rate can be reduce by lower the amount of obstacle.
<br>
<h3>2. Task in real life</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the task ramdomly generated obstacles are represent the danger environment in a flight operation, but in real life the danger zone could be in 3 dimention. Instead of planning in 2D matrix, algorithm must consider in 3D, in addition the rate of forming loop in the map will be much lower in a 3D path planing

# **9 | Reflective Essay**
<h2>Shek Ho Ching Ken (22075211D)</h2>

<p>
  This project is my first GitHub project in my life. Althrough using a Python, HTML, Markdown to do this project is challenging for me, it is a great experience for me to learn, try and overcome.
     From this project, I can enhance my skills,for example,  Problem solving skill which help me to break down a large problem into small easy tasks, Leadership which help me to collect groupmate ideas with a efficent way.
    Recalling the first day, I asked my groupmates what strength they have, and found that i was the only one who good at program. In that moment I knew I need to pay more effort in the code explaining, therefore i had made a document that detaily break explain the A-Star Algorithm. Up to now I think I can to it better that i should use more daily example instead of difficlt term in the document.
    Beside the document, i had also create a Workflow list for us to catch up and it will be better if we can more frequently share what task have been done. So that we can more like to help eachother and more easy to catch up the progress.
    In conclusion, I satisfied my performance, I have room to improve the skills of commulation and atmosphere constructing.

This is my first Github project I have ever did and it also is one of the few group project in my past experience.During the process of finishing this project,it brings me a lot of useful skills in improving my communication and problem solving ability.In this Github project, my job is mainly focus on calculating and the report. However,for the coding, since I am lack of knowledge in computer science in programming, all of the coding and programming are passes to my teemates and I am not be able to help them even a little bit. I feel that I have a lot of deficiencies on progamming and coding. Therefore, I need to practice my skills and learn more knowledge on programming to help my teammates more on coding for separating their workload instead of just preparing the report.

<h2>Namira Sultana(22104453D)</h2>

  This project was my first foray into utilizing GitHub, and I've learned a lot from it. The tasks provided helped me better understand aviation as I learned about path planning and how an airline may reduce travel costs by using a shorter route while keeping in mind the cost-intensive areas. Additionally, using GitHub for coding and code sharing made it simpler for us to collaborate on our project. In addition to creating a repository, editing it, and merging my changes, GitHub improved my teamworking skills. My communication skills improved as a result of getting to know the other team members and discussing ideas with them. If a team member was unable to solve a problem, it would not be a cause for concern because the other team members would assist and through combined efforts, produce a superior solution. Since it was challenging for me to find the answers to the problems through coding, I focused more on the report writing and presentation. Working on the repository also taught me about the syntaxes for readme report and inserting gifs, producing the report, and a variety of other things. In conclusion, working with my team members and finishing the project successfully has been a wonderful experience.

<h2>Shek Tsun Ho Wilbert(22093977D)</h2>

<p>
  This is the first time that I use GitHub for a group project and I have experienced a lot, from coding or understanding the codes to making the report, and I have learned a lot from that. Through participating in the project, I have the chance to code, though it's not much as I am bad at coding, I also have the chance to make a report by using html syntax, which I've never done that before in high school. I've learned a lot about the logic flow of a piece of codes as well as a proper thinking process to code when we have literally nothing that can take reference on. I've also learned a lot about the basics of html syntax by making part of the report on GitHub, which I believe will be useful in future, no matter other projects in the university or even in future workplace. I also learned a lot from the difficulties I faced during the project. As I've just mentioned, I am bad at coding. Therefore when I was trying to do the additional task 2 by myself, which I failed and ended up reading other's code, I had huge difficulties for accomplishing the requirement of making the distance between the start and the destination at least 50 units. Then our group leader Ken helped me solve the problem by introducing the method of "locus", which really blew my mind. Then I understand that sometimes, not only in coding, we really have to think outside the box to approach problems in an innovative way. In short, I've really learned a lot from this GitHub project and I wish more simillar experience in the future.

   After studying in university, this is the first group project I had. In this project, we were taught in order to complete different type of tasks using a various of engineering tools such as Python, VS Code and GitHub etc. During the whole project, GitHub acts as an important role between us. We are able to type in what we have found out into this online platform anywhere and anytime as well as ask for requests before commit changes directly which helps me to ask for all groupmates’ agreement. However, as I am not familiar with programming, I have participated in writing the report of the tasks (ReadMe) instead. I was assigned to type out the results and reflections in our project’s report. During this group project, I have learned a lot which helps me improve in not only communication skills but also problem-solving skills. It is because I need to communicate with my groupmates to enhance my understanding of the whole program they have written. Finishing this a big project with my teammates, I am glad that I have met some groupmates who are nice and easy-going. In conclusion, l have learned many skills and I wish to have more chances to have such project.

<h2>Pun Leong Ka(22074626D)</h2>
The Github project is the first project I have ever done by using python and Visual Studio Code. The project is challenging that it required high problem-solving and python skills. After using Github, I realized that it is a good platform for me to learn more about high level coding as people can share their programs and ideas wherever they are. In the project, my role is to do the report and the reflection ince I am not good at python.Although my tasks are comparatively easy, I find some difficulties in presenting the ideas and read my teammates's codes. My leader helped me a lot in explaining the codes and we discussed to use histogram and chart to show and explain the data. By doing the project, I learn the importance to have a good team thst good communication can make the work better. I would like to learn more about coding in the future. In conclusion, it is nice to have my teammates work together and I hope I can have more experience in doing group projects like this time.
