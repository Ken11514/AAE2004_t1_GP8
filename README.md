# 1 | Background of Path Planing to Aviation Engineering
paragraph1:
- [x] Imform people *Whatis* **Path Finding** 
 ```    
1 Find the shortest and the most obstacle-free path from a start to goal state
2 Can be widely applied in partially and unknown structured environment
3 Save cost and increase efficiency
```
paragraph2: 
- [ ] Telling people *How* we finding path with purpose
```     
1 Python(Computer language)
2 A-Star(Path finding algorithm) -> find the shortest path from a specified source to a specified goal
3 VS code(Platform)
```
paragraph3: 
- [x] Introduce people *What* we are going to do in this porject 
```
1 Find the shortest and most cost-efficient route and aircraft for a flight in 3 different scenarios
2 Design a new cost area -> reduce the cost of the route
3 Design a new aircraft model -> achive minimum cost
```

# 5 | Task 2
## a. Methodology
## b. Results
## c. Descussion
## Introduction
- [x] : How the task related to daily aviation

        The area designed in task 2 represents jet-stream area where aircrafts could consume relatively less fuel
        -> reduce the cost of flights
        
- [x] : Task objective

        Recreate a jet-steam area in the map that could most benefit our flight route. 
        
## Content
- [x] : Thhings to do

        Design a new cost area -> reduce the cost of the route of scenario 1 in task 1
         
- [x] : How and what we have done (explain with result)

        1 Base on the scenario 1 in Task 1
        2 Create a reduce-cost area in the map (size: vertical lengths:5 , horizontal length:infinity [cyan in colour])
        3 Finding the lowest Trip Cost in pothntial.
