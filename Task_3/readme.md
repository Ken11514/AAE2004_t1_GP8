## Things To DO
• Design a new aircraft to best fit Scenario 1 in task 1

• Only consider cruise time of the flight

• Also design the passenger capacity of the aircraft,
for each 50 passenger (min 100 to max 450) increase
time cost by 2 $/min (Base CT = 12 $/min)

• The base design is a twin-engine aircraft, if capacity >= 300, you must switch to a 4-engine aircraft

• 𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐= 2000 for twin-engine aircrafts, 2500 for 4-
engine aircrafts

• Each engine consumes fuel at 20kg/min

• Follow the trip cost equation and materials on the
next slides to design your aircraft:
