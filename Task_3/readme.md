# Task Objective
Design a new aircraft by finding out its parameters based on the restrictions

## Our Map

## Things To Do 
• Design a new aircraft to best fit Scenario 1 in task 1

• Only consider cruise time of the flight

• Also design the passenger capacity of the aircraft,
for each 50 passenger (min 100 to max 450) increase
time cost by 2 $/min (Base C_{T} = 12 $/min)

• The base design is a twin-engine aircraft, if capacity >= 300, you must switch to a 4-engine aircraft

•  $C_{C}$ = 2000 for twin-engine aircrafts, 2500 for 4-
engine aircrafts

• Each engine consumes fuel at 20kg/min

• Follow the trip cost equation and materials design your aircraft:

$C_{F}$ = cost of fuel per kg

$C_{T}$ = time related cost per minute of flight

$C_{C}$ = fixed cost independent of time

$\Delta F$ = trip fuel

$T_{best}$ = trip time

## AIRCRAFT MODEL DESIGN (task3)
###  Introduction
To find out the best fit the situation.  We designed three models with diffenert Capacity (capacity per aircraft): 

Model 1: 250  

Model 2: 300 

Model 3: 450

### Table of value

According to the Rules of restrictions of TASK 3, 

the Value to find out the best fit model aircraft could be shown as this able:

| Airplane Capacity& Model |    $\Delta F$  |$T_{best}$ |  $C_{C}$ |  $C_{T}$   |  $C_{F}$ | Number of trip required  |   Total cost  |
| :--------         | :------- | :------- |:---------  | :--------- |:--------   | :--------| :--------|
| (Model 1) 250 | 40kg/min        | 77.1837664107356 /min  | 2000  $/flight   |  22  $/min        | 0.8823  $/kg         | 12   | $77064 |
| (Model 2) 300|  80kg/min        | 77.1837664107356    min| 2500   $/flight       |  24  $/min        | 0.8823 $/kg          | 10   | $98003 |                
| (Model 3) 450|  80kg/min        | 77.1837664107356   min  | 2500  $/flight    |  30  $/min        | 0.8823  $/kg | 7    | $71844 |              

### Trip cost calculations for each model

Model 1 (250) :77.183766410736*0.8823*40 + 2000*77.1837664107356 + 2000 = 77064

Model 2 (300) :77.183766410736*0.8823*80 + 2500*77.1837664107356 + 2500 = 98033

Model 3 (450) :77.183766410736*0.8823*80 + 2500*77.1837664107356 + 2500 = 71844

### About our aircraft:
#### The name of our aircraft
The name of this aircraft will be P801, P stands for Polyu,(8) stands for our group number and finish the mission with the highest efficiency and takeing the lowest cost and requirment are the meanings of (01)
#### Passengers capacity
As you can see,the table has shown that the most important element of lower the operating cost is the total number of trips required for transporting all the passengers.The aircraft in model 3 require the lowest operating cost and number of trips is the lowest one in 3 model. Therefore,the maxmium passengers capacity of our aircraft will be 450 to reach the possible lowest operating cost.
#### Enginee count
There will be 4 enginees on our aircraft. 
#### Route
Since our table used the 0.8823 $/kg as the fuel cost, our aircrafft can fly globally.
