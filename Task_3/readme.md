# Task Objective
Desing a nwe aircraft by finding out its parameters based on the reestrictions

## Our Map

## Things To Do 
• Design a new aircraft to best fit Scenario 1 in task 1

• Only consider cruise time of the flight

• Also design the passenger capacity of the aircraft,
for each 50 passenger (min 100 to max 450) increase
time cost by 2 $/min (Base CT = 12 $/min)

• The base design is a twin-engine aircraft, if capacity >= 300, you must switch to a 4-engine aircraft

• 𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐= 2000 for twin-engine aircrafts, 2500 for 4-
engine aircrafts

• Each engine consumes fuel at 20kg/min

• Follow the trip cost equation and materials design your aircraft:

𝐶f=cost of fuel per kg

𝐶𝑇=time related cost per minute of flight

𝐶𝑐=fixed cost independent of time

∆𝐹=trip fuel

∆𝑇=trip time

## AIRCRAFT MODEL DESIGN (task3)
Introduction
To find out the best fit the situation.  We designed three models with diffenert Capacity: 

Model 1: 250,  Model 2: 300 & Model 3: 450.

According to the Rules of ResTrictions of TASK 3, 

the Value to find out the best fit model aircraft could be shown as this able:

| Airplane Capacity& Model |    ∆𝐹    |∆𝑇        | Cc         |𝐶𝑇          |𝐶f         | 
| :--------         | :------- | :------- |:---------  | :--------- |:--------   |
| (Model 1) 250 |          |          |            |            |            |                       
| (Model 2) 300|          |          |            |            |            |                       
| (Model 3) 400|          |          |            |            |            |
